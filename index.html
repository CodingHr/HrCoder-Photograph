            <div class="title">James "Jimmy" Philip Nelson is an English photographer.</div>
            <p>James Philip Nelson was born in 1967 in Sevenoaks, Kent.[1][better source needed] He spent his childhood
                in Africa, Asia and South America, traveling around with his father, who worked as a geologist for
                International Shell. At the age of 7, he was sent to Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit boarding school in
                Lancashire, UK. When he was 16, he developed Alopecia totalis, a condition in which all the hair falls
                out, which was caused by a culmination of stress and a reaction to malaria medication.</p>
            <p>In 1985, at age 17, he left his boarding school and started to trek the length of Tibet on foot. He took
                a small camera on his trip and photographed his journey, which lasted about two years.</p>
            <p>Upon return, the collection of pictures he had taken in the formerly inaccessible country were published
                by the English National Geographic, to wide international acclaim.[4]
                Following this journey, Nelson embarked on more trips, documenting a variety of war zones, including
                Afghanistan, Kashmir, Yugoslavia, Somalia and El Salvador, and started to work as a professional
                photojournalist, until the age of 24!</p>
            <p>Nelson defended his work against the criticism of Survival International in a BBC interview, explaining,
                "The pictures are definitely arranged. People don't naturally stand under a waterfall at 7 AM waiting
                for the sun to rise, unless you ask them to. I'm presenting these people in a way that hasn't been done
                before. We present ourselves in the developed world in a very idealised, stylised way because we believe
                we are important. I've given them the time, the respect that we would give ourselves..."[5] "The title
                [Before They Pass Away] was melodramatic," Nelson said in an interview with WBUR. "A little naive.
                Everyone got upset saying, "Who's dying?" It was a little bit naive, but then it actually paid off
                because it caused a big discussion.</p>
            <p>In 1992 Nelson was commissioned by Shell Oil to produce the book "Literary Portraits of China". He
                travelled across the country for 30 months, together with his then wife, Ashkaine Hora Adema, who
                participated in the making of the book, and became the subsequent business partner of Nelson.</p>
